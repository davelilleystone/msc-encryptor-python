# ðŸ”‘ Python File Encryption Utility â€” Development Blueprint

## 1. Setup
- Create project folder (`msc-encryptor-python/`).
- Set up virtual environment.
- Install dependencies (e.g., `cryptography`).
- Create folder structure:

```
msc-encryptor-python/
src/
tests/
data/
```
## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Add entry script (e.g., `main.py`).
- Implement CLI arguments:
- `encrypt <input> <output>`
- `decrypt <input> <output>`

## 3. Key Management
- Accept user-supplied password.
- Derive encryption key from password (e.g., PBKDF2).
- Ensure consistent key generation for encryption/decryption.

## 4. Encryption Logic
- Read input file.
- Encrypt contents with AES (using derived key).
- Write encrypted file to output.

## 5. Decryption Logic
- Read encrypted file.
- Decrypt using same password-derived key.
- Write decrypted data to output file.

## 6. Error Handling
- Handle wrong password attempts gracefully.
- Check for missing/invalid files.
- Prevent overwriting files unless explicitly allowed.

## 7. Testing
- Unit tests:
- Encrypt + decrypt returns original content.
- Empty file test.
- Wrong password test.
- Manual testing with sample `.txt` files.

## 8. Documentation
- Inline comments in code.
- README: purpose, usage, requirements, how to run.
- Example usage with test files.
